>Cubed uses a custom pack for our new main project, Andea. Created solely for this project, Cubed Textures has been focused on realism and useful textures for meeting our needs. This pack relies on Optifine to operate correctly, making use of many features such as biome-specific textures, custom models and connected textures. If you're using this for the first time, we advise visiting /warp pack on our Minecraft server for a full repository of blocks, items and textures you can utilise.

✚ This pack requires OptiFine. Download it!
