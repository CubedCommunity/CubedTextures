Cubed uses a custom pack for our new main project, Andea. Created solely for this project, Cubed Textures has been focused on realism and useful textures for meeting our needs. This pack relies on Optifine to operate correctly, making use of many features such as biome-specific textures, custom models and connected textures. If you're using this for the first time, we advise visiting /warp pack on our Minecraft server for a full repository of blocks, items and textures you can utilise.

#### ✚ How to install:

1. Download and install Optifine for 1.13.2. You can find the download above.
2. Download the desired pack version. We suggest the most latest release.
3. Move (or download) the file to ``%appdata%/roaming/.minecraft/resourcepacks.``
4. Run Minecraft with Optifine and access your resource-pack folder via the in-game menu.
5. Select the Cubed Textures resource-pack.
6. Kappa! You can also view the pack’s features via /warp Pack on our creative server.



#### ✚ Remember to enable Connected Textures.

Enable connected textures, set leaves to fancy and shadows to 20%. Bugged shadows can occur on complex models with multiple faces; playing around with different shadow percentages can often solve this so we recommend setting shadows to 20% or less. Our resourcepack works best with Shaders! You can try out these shaders that work amazingly with Cubed Textures:
