Cubed uses a custom pack for our new main project, Andea. Created solely for this project, Cubed Textures has been focused on realism and useful textures for meeting our needs. This pack relies on Optifine to operate correctly, making use of many features such as biome-specific textures, custom models and connected textures. If you're using this for the first time, we advise visiting /warp pack on our Minecraft server for a full repository of blocks, items and textures you can utilise.

✚ Remember to enable Connected Textures.

  » Enable connected textures, set leaves to fancy and shadows to 20%. Bugged shadows can occur on complex models with multiple faces; playing around with different shadow percentages can often solve this.
